        <li>
          You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to
          exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable
          fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
          Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these
          circumstances.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may need to request specific information from you to help us
          confirm your identity and ensure your rights to access your Personal
          Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
          measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person
          who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for
          further information in relation to your request to speed up our
          response.
        </li>
        <li>
          We try to respond to all legitimate requests
          within&nbsp;[one]&nbsp;month. Occasionally it may take us longer
          than&nbsp;[a]&nbsp;month if your request is particularly complex or
          you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you
          and keep you updated.

          of our external third parties are also based outside of the EEA so
          their processing of your Personal Data will involve a transfer of data
          outside the EEA. We may transfer personal data from EEA to third

          Whenever we transfer your Personal Data out of the EEA, we ensure a
          similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least
          one of the following safeguards is implemented:
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          We will only transfer your Personal Data to countries that have been

          the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission:
          Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission
          which give Personal Data the same protection it has in Europe. For
          further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the
          transfer of personal data to third countries.
        </li>
        <li>
          In respect of transfers to entities in the US, we may transfer
          Personal Data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which
          requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared
          between Europe and the US. For further details, see European
